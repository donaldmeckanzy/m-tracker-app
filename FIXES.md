# Bug Fixes Applied to M-Tracker

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Timer Pause/Resume Logic Fixed
**Problem**: When pausing and resuming the timer, it would restart from the beginning instead of continuing from where it was paused.

**Solution**: 
- Added `pausedTime` field to the timer store to track accumulated time
- Modified the timer calculation to include both paused time and current session time
- Updated pause/resume logic to properly maintain state

**Changes Made**:
- `src/renderer/src/stores/timerStore.ts`: Added pausedTime tracking
- `src/renderer/src/components/Timer/Timer.tsx`: Updated useEffect to handle pausedTime
- Timer now correctly resumes from where it was paused

### 2. âœ… Sessions Not Appearing in Dashboard
**Problem**: After stopping a task, it would vanish and not show up under recent sessions.

**Solution**:
- Created `useSessions` hook for proper database integration
- Updated timer store to save sessions to Supabase when stopping
- Modified Dashboard to fetch and display real session data
- Added proper session data flow from timer â†’ database â†’ dashboard

**Changes Made**:
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useSessions.ts`: New hook for session management
- `src/renderer/src/stores/timerStore.ts`: Updated to save sessions to database
- `src/renderer/src/components/Timer/Timer.tsx`: Integrated session saving
- `src/renderer/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`: Real-time session display

### 3. âœ… Dashboard Not Updating with Real Data
**Problem**: Dashboard showed static "0h 0m" instead of actual daily/weekly totals.

**Solution**:
- Integrated `useSessions` hook to calculate real-time totals
- Added today's total time calculation
- Added weekly progress tracking
- Added progress bars and goal completion percentages

**Changes Made**:
- `src/renderer/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`: 
  - Dynamic data from database
  - Real-time progress calculations
  - Visual progress indicators

### 4. âœ… Daily Goal Not Updating from Settings
**Problem**: Dashboard always showed default 6h goal even after changing and saving in settings.

**Solution**:
- Created proper settings integration in Dashboard
- Added `useSettings` hook integration
- Real-time settings updates across components
- Proper progress calculation based on saved goals

**Changes Made**:
- `src/renderer/src/hooks/useSettings.ts`: Settings management with persistence
- `src/renderer/src/components/Settings/Settings.tsx`: Save functionality
- `src/renderer/src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`: Dynamic goal display

### 5. âœ… Database Schema & Security
**Problem**: No database tables existed for storing sessions and settings.

**Solution**:
- Created complete database schema with proper relationships
- Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Created indexes for performance
- Added automatic timestamp triggers

**Changes Made**:
- `database-schema.sql`: Complete database setup script
- `DATABASE_SETUP.md`: Step-by-step setup guide

## Technical Improvements

### Timer Store Enhancements
```typescript
interface TimerState {
  // Added pausedTime to track accumulated time during pauses
  pausedTime: number;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Settings Management
- Added React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Implemented optimistic updates for better UX
- Added proper error handling and loading states

### UI/UX Improvements
- Better visual feedback for different timer states
- Save button appears only when there are unsaved changes
- Loading spinners for async operations
- Clear indication of current timer state (running/paused/stopped)

## Database Structure

### Tables Created
1. **work_sessions**: Stores all timed work sessions
2. **user_preferences**: Stores user settings (daily goals, theme, etc.)

### Security
- Row Level Security enabled
- Users can only access their own data
- Proper authentication checks

## Testing the Fixes

### Timer Testing
1. Start a timer with a task name
2. Let it run for a few seconds
3. Pause it - timer should stop but maintain elapsed time
4. Resume it - timer should continue from where it was paused
5. Stop it - session should be saved, task name should remain visible

### Settings Testing
1. Go to Settings
2. Change daily goal or theme
3. Notice "Save Settings" button appears
4. Click save - should show loading state then success
5. Refresh or navigate away and back - settings should persist

### Task Persistence Testing
1. Start a timer with a task
2. Work for some time
3. Stop the timer
4. Task name should remain visible
5. You should be able to start a new session or continue with the same task

## Development Server
The application is now running with all fixes applied:
- Vite dev server on http://localhost:5174 (or available port)
- Electron app should launch automatically
- Hot reload enabled for development

All fixes have been tested and are working properly! ðŸŽ‰
